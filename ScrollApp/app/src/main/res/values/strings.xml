        Computer programming is the process of accomplishing a specific computing result or to perform a particular computation, usually by designing/building an executable computer program.\n Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms\' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). What is coding?

You’ve heard tons about coding and know that it has to do with computers and how they process the information we see. However, you may not have much more than this vague understanding of the concept. Don’t feel bad. Many people don’t really understand it, though we all depend on the fundamentals of code each and every day. It’s such an important aspect of the technological landscape that, according to Fortune, former President Obama unveiled an initiative called “Computer Science for All” that has been backed by and invested in by big names, including the Turner Broadcasting Network. This movement is one that mirrors that of our nation’s schools that have been emphasizing the value of technology, computer science, engineering, and other STEM-related topics. Read on to discover what computer code is and why it is of such importance in today’s society.
        To put it very simply, the code is what tells your computer what to do. To go a bit deeper, computers don’t understand words. They only understand the concepts of on and off. The capabilities of a computer are guided by on and off switches, or transistors. Binary code represents these on and off transistors as the digits 1 and 0. An infinite number of combinations of these codes make your computer work. In order to make binary code manageable, computer programming languages were formed. These languages each serve different purposes, but they all allow programmers to translate important commands into binary code.

Each computer application needs a properly written code to know what to do. Most software has thousands to billions of lines of coded text and numbers. The code gives computers a step-by-step guide on how to function. Computers speed through reading the code to execute every online and offline task. In today’s digital world, everything from mobile phones to smart TVs and cars run using coded software. For example, the code might tell the computer to input an image and make it spin. Creating flawless code is essential to avoid 404 error pop-ups and software crashes. Debugging code is always the final step to reveal and fix coding issues.

        Coding isn’t that hard for tech-savvy people who patiently put in the time and effort to learn. Coding gets an unnecessarily bad reputation from people who weren’t persistent enough to practice. The easiest coding languages only involve a few hundred terms and rules to remember. That’s a tiny sliver in comparison to learning a spoken foreign language. Once the easier languages are mastered, it’s relatively simple to learn other ways to code. Many programming languages use similar methods to code and debug computer applications.

Beginners starting to code must possess certain skills to be successful. Having strong attention to detail to pour over long lines of coded text is imperative. New coders need abstract thinking skills to visualize what written code will become. Novices must have problem-solving skills to persist against challenges without letting frustration win. Intuitive logical reasoning skills help coders correctly conclude why a code isn’t working right. Good writing skills are critical to creating code that appropriately conveys the intended message. Technology skills are also an obvious requirement for coders to fearlessly work with computer programs.
